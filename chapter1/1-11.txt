How would you test the word count program?
Write some unit tests that ensure the word count program produces the correct output for specific test cases.
I would start with the following test cases.
-program returns zero word count for no input and input that contains only blanks, newlines, or tabs
-program returns correct word count for words separated by newlines
-program returns correct word count for words separated by tabs
-program returns correct word count for words separated by blanks

What kinds of inputs are most likely to uncover bugs, if there are any?
inputs with a very large number of characters, newlines, and words will cause the int counters to overflow.
